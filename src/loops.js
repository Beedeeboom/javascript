//Loops
//A for loop contains three expressions separated by ; inside the parentheses:

//1. an initialization starts the loop and can also be used to declare the iterator variable.
//2.a stopping condition is the condition that the iterator variable is evaluated againstâ€” if the condition evaluates to true the code block will run, and if it evaluates to false the code will stop.
//3. an iteration statement is used to update the iterator variable on each loop.

for (let counter = 0; counter < 4; counter++) {
    console.log(counter);
  } //prints 0 1 2 3


for (let number = 5; number <= 10; number++) { //the variable declaration defines the start of the loop
console.log(number) //prints 5 6 7 8 9 10
}

//We can also loop in reverse
for (let counter = 3; counter >= 0; counter--){
    console.log(counter);
  }

//Looping through Arrays
const vacationSpots = ['Bali', 'Paris', 'Tulum'];
for (let i = 0; i < vacationSpots.length; i++){
  console.log(`I would love to visit ${vacationSpots[i]}`)
}

//prints I would love to visit Bali - I would love to visit Paris - I would love to visit Tulum

//Nested loops
//the below contains 3 arrays
//the duplicates from array 1 and 2 are pushed into array 3
let bobsFollowers = ['Joe', 'Marta', 'Sam', 'Erin'];
let tinasFollowers = ['Sam', 'Marta', 'Elle'];
let mutualFollowers = [];

for (let i = 0; i < bobsFollowers.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < tinasFollowers.length; j++) {
    if (bobsFollowers[i] === tinasFollowers[j]) {
      mutualFollowers.push(bobsFollowers[i]);
    }
  }
};
