//Loops
//A for loop contains three expressions separated by ; inside the parentheses:

//1. an initialization starts the loop and can also be used to declare the iterator variable.
//2.a stopping condition is the condition that the iterator variable is evaluated againstâ€” if the condition evaluates to true the code block will run, and if it evaluates to false the code will stop.
//3. an iteration statement is used to update the iterator variable on each loop.

for (let counter = 0; counter < 4; counter++) {
    console.log(counter);
  } //prints 0 1 2 3


for (let number = 5; number <= 10; number++) { //the variable declaration defines the start of the loop
console.log(number) //prints 5 6 7 8 9 10
}

//We can also loop in reverse
for (let counter = 3; counter >= 0; counter--){
    console.log(counter);
  }
