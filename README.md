#Learning Javascript

###Using Javascript with HTML

To write Javascript code with HTML we need to wrap our code within script tags. These can be placed in the head, body or after the body section of the HTML document.

We can output Javascript within HTML code with document.write(), example:

```
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>

    <h1>Introduction to Javascript</h1>
    <p>Javascript Code with HTML</p>

    <script>
        let myFirstjavascript = "I love Javascript"
        console.log(myFirstjavascript)
    </script>

    </body>
    </html>
```
